    <p>An amazing thing happens when you get honest with yourself and start doing what you love, what makes you happy.
        Your life literally slows down. 
        You stop wishing for the weekend. 
        You stop merely looking forward tospecial events.
        You begin to live in each moment and you start feeling like a human bieng.
        You just ride the wave that is life, with this feeling of contentment and joy.
        You move fluidly, steadily, calm and grateful. A veil
        is lifted, and a whole new perspective is born.

    <blockquote>Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.
