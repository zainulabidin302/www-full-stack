# Before you build a website: YOU NEED A DESIGN
  To build a website, you should have a clear picture of what the website will look like. There are many tools which can help you to create your design.
  for example   
  * Adobe Photoshop
  * Adobe Illustrator
  * Sketch (Mac)t
  * Gimp (Ubuntu)
  
  On the other hand, you can also buy or pick a free design from the internet. ThemeForest is a great place to start searching your desired design. If you want a customized design, you can hire some one on fiverr or online freelancer marketplace. For the purpose of this tutorial, I am using a design from [Dribble](https://dribbble.com).

# UI/UX
  The term user experience is relatively new then user interface. [UX](https://www.forbes.com/sites/propointgraphics/2017/07/15/the-rise-of-the-ux-goldrush/#5f8727cf5829). User interface refers to the look of the website while UX is related to the feel. While a web designer should be aware of these things, design thinking is usually done in the design phase. Web developers will usually be more focused on implementing the design.
