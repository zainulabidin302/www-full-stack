# What is HTML?
  HTML is markup language.  
  > HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.  As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
