# What is HTML?
  HTML is markup language.  
  > HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.  As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

  Have a look at the closing and opening of each tag. We will do more example on this so it will be clear that the same sytax is followed everywhere.

# Tags (Elements)

# Nested Elements
  To make html more useful and powerful, we nest elements inside each other.

# Hierarchy / Categorization
  Nesting will turn our documents to structured documents just XML.

# How many tags are there?
  A good reference for finding a tag of your need is [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp). They have an updated list of tags including their compatibility information. They also have live examples and demos for each tag which is a good way to test the tag before using it.

  But that is not the only reference available. Another great reference is
