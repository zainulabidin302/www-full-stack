  There are many ways to build a beautiful website. The easiest one is to pick some kind of Automatic Website Builder.
  
# Website builders
  There are many powerfull website builders or editors. Usually they are [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editors which may and may not provide access to code. They provide plugins for various tasks.   
  for example
  * Wix
  * Shopify
  
  In this tutorial, we are focusing on how to build a website from scratch. But it is good to that they are great ways of building great looking websites in just a few hours or even less.

# Before you build a website, You Need a Design
  We need a design to understand the look and feel of our website. This is not a prerequisite for building a great website, but it is a great way to understand the requirements. There are many tools which can help us create a wondorful design.
  for example   
  * [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
  * [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
  * [Sketch (Mac)](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
  * [Gimp (Ubuntu)](https://www.gimp.org/)
  
  On the other hand, you can also buy or pick a free design from the internet. 
  for example 
  * [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net)
  * [Behance](https://www.behance.net)
  * [TemplateMonstor](https://www.templatemonster.com/)
  * [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com)
  * [Dribble](https://dribbble.com)
  
  
  There will be times, when we will need customized design to fullfill our need. For that purpose, we can hire someone from an online freelance marketplace. 
  for example
  * [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com)
  * [Upwork](http://upwork.com)

  You can also throw a design challenge. In this case you will put your requirements on a marketplace, and many designers will create designs to meets your requirements. You can then choose a design from the competition. Design challenges can be created on  specialized marketplaces.
  for example 
  * [99design](https://99designs.com)
  * [DesignCrowd](https://www.designcrowd.com/)
  
  [Dribble](https://dribbble.com) is a great place to find ideas and free designs. It has a rich community. 

  
# UI/UX
  The term user experience is relatively new then user interface. [UX](https://www.forbes.com/sites/propointgraphics/2017/07/15/the-rise-of-the-ux-goldrush/#5f8727cf5829). User interface refers to the look of the website while UX is related to the feel. While a web designer should be aware of these things, design thinking is usually done in the design phase. Web developers will usually be more focused on implementing the design. 
  
# Pixel perfect design
  A pixel perfect design is literally a perfect implementation of design into code. It is not easy to do and especially with responsive and flexible layouts, it becomes much harder to do. Nevertheless, it is not unodable. You need to carefully code your design and have a good understanding of everything you do. In past, people used slicing for converting a psd design to html and css. Don't do this [PSD to HTML](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/psd-to-html-is-dead). Modern workflows to convert html to css are much better, productive and leverage power of modern browsers.  [PSD to HTML (work flow)](https://www.xfive.co/blog/psd-to-html-is-not-dead/)
  
  For the next tutorial we will use [Waxom](https://dribbble.com/shots/2466735-Waxom-Free-Homepage-PSD-Template) PSD template and start converting it to HTML.
